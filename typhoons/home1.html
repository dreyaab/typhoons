                  <p class="large-text">A typhoon is a formidable tropical cyclone characterized by sustained winds of at least 74 mph (119 km/h). Forming over warm ocean waters, it brings intense winds, heavy rainfall, storm surges, and flooding, posing significant risks to coastal areas and infrastructure, often causing widespread devastation.</p>

                  <p class="large-text">Typhoons form over warm ocean waters when atmospheric conditions are conducive, including high humidity, low wind shear, and the Coriolis effect. As warm air rises, it creates an area of low pressure, drawing in more warm air. This process continues, feeding the storm and intensifying it into a powerful cyclone.</p>

                  <p class="large-text">Typhoons can have devastating impacts, including widespread destruction of infrastructure, homes, and crops due to strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges. They can also cause loss of life, displacement of populations, disruptions to transportation and communication, and long-term economic setbacks for affected regions.<br>

                     After Typhoon Parma, an outbreak of Leptospirosis hit Marikina and surrounding areas, with over 1,900 admissions and 148 deaths reported. Prophylaxis efforts targeted 1.3 million at-risk individuals. Measures included medical care, psychosocial support, and water testing. Private hospitals waived fees, and assistance was requested from global health organizations. </p>

                  <p class="large-text">Typhoons, known as hurricanes or cyclones in other regions, are categorized based on their sustained wind speeds. Tropical depressions have winds below 39 mph. Tropical storms have winds between 39 and 73 mph. Typhoons have winds of at least 74 mph, while super typhoons have winds exceeding 150 mph. Each type poses varying degrees of danger and potential damage.</p>
