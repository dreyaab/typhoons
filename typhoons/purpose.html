        <p class="p2">Our mission is propelled by the critical imperative to inform communities about the health perils linked to typhoons. These storms not only inflict immediate physical devastation but also harbor grave health hazards, notably the proliferation of waterborne illnesses like cholera and leptospirosis due to tainted water sources. Through extensive educational campaigns, we aim to arm individuals with the know-how and tools to mitigate these risks, from mastering preventive techniques such as water purification to identifying early signs of waterborne ailments and accessing prompt medical aid. By amplifying awareness and instilling proactive health habits, we endeavor to curtail the toll of typhoons on public health and bolster community resilience amidst natural calamities. To help the community learn more about the diseases, we made a video about the diseases. 
         <br><br>
         Typhoons can lead to disease outbreaks due to contaminated water sources, disrupted sanitation, and increased exposure to pathogens. Floodwaters carry sewage and pollutants, contaminating drinking water and facilitating the spread of waterborne diseases like cholera and typhoid. Poor hygiene conditions exacerbate the risk of infection during and after typhoons.
